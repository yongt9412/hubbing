> "Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world."
> ~ Nelson Mandela

Today, Nelson Mandela would have had his 100th birthday. As he said, education is the key to fight injustice, inequality and poverty. We can be proud to see that the proliferation of quality education rose to an alltime high in many countries across the world.
However, there are also parts of the world where children and youths do not have access to good education. Good teachers are a scarce and schools lack of quality material. Young people are the future of the world, however if youths do not receive meaningful and effective education, it is impossible to convert the demographic preponderance into useful human capital for the development for the human society.

## Can online learning educate people who would otherwise have no chance to go to a quality school?
Currently, the sorts of education administered in most parts of the world have a fixed structure. Students go to school and knowledge is banked in them by teachers, waiting to be withdrawn during tests and examinations. However, the world is changing. There is a remarkable shift from conventional learning systems to mastery-based learning approaches. New technologies make it possible to learn online.

However, online learning is premised on the seemingly false assumption that individual students on their own have the capacity to assimilate and gain knowledge unaided. Studies show that the learning is more effective, if students have a guidance to learn. Given that the knowledge comes from online sources, the guides do not necessarily have to be masters in the subject. They can be just mediators or even other students.

One may be tempted to ask: in this case, why is the conventional teaching method not better than online education models? This is due to the lack of qualified teachers and the rigid scheduling of educational systems. UNESCO estimates that there would be 69 Million additional teachers needed worldwide to provide global education on the conventional model. Given this problem, students can use online curricula and courses to teach each other and learn from each other.

We have seen countries skipping milestones in both technology and lifestyle. See the internet as an example. In most european countries, telephone cables were installed a hundred years ago. Today, we still use them while in the meantime, countries which developed later went directly to mobile internet. Why? Because it is unintelligent to invest in an old technology when newer ones exist.

When we apply this concept to education, it means that countries that have enough teachers can try to improve their current system. However, for those countries that are in a desperate need of teachers, new technologies like online learning can be the right way into the future.

Nelson Mandela made education accessible for the large majority of people in South Africa. Of course, due to the lack of teachers, the system is still far from perfect. We can take this forward by building new systems that rotate to the new, and people can gain mastery of skills that will enable them access better jobs, career progression and fulfilment.
As we can measure a rise in the popularity of online learning in some developed countries, it might be the right time to bring it to more regions of the world so they can develop.
