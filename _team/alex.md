about: Alex studies Computer Engineering at Vienna University of Technology. When in recent years the proliferation of extremist beliefs became rose, Alex started to do research on how people build up their mind. He discovered that the underlying problems already start in school where children are not incentivised to work their own brain to obtain new knowledge but rather to remember what the teachers told them. He believes that it is necessary to change the way people learn so that they will train their critical thinking and are ready for the future.
