Few months have passed since we started the journey with Hubbing. A long way that started out of nothing but a group of young education advocates. The team was formed in <a href="http://ysiglobal.com/" target="_blank">Young Sustainable Impact’s (YSI)</a> global innovation program that aims at empowering youth to create startups that tackle sustainability challenges.

In a way full of new learnings, the team was honored to be portrayed in a documentary by <a href="https://okjworks.com/ysi-global/" target="_blank">OKJ Works</a> “To Change The World: A YSI Global Story”.

The documentary was released yesterday and contains an overview of the process of creating Hubbing.

Watch the documentary below and leave a message of support. Let’s build a sustainable world together.
