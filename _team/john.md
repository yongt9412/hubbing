about: John studied Computer Systems Engineering at Del Valle University in La Paz, Bolivia. While growing in an environment filled with social disparities, racism and discrimination, John wanted to take action. He realised that education is the best way to tackle social problems while empowering the people. If everyone is capable of knowing what they know, they do not only keep a competitive advantage in their knowledge field but also are capable of structure their mind to learn better. He believes that the best way to improve the lifestyle of people, is through assessing the knowledge they have and improving their skills constantly.
