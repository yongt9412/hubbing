We are frustrated by how students go to school and are disincentivized and unmotivated to learn. In many schools, the objective is to pass the exam, not to learn something for life.

The world is developing so fast, how can it be that the education system remains the same in most countries?

Instead of lamenting, we take action. If governments don't revolutionize the way of learning, we do it ourselves.
We're not just a learning platform, we're a community.
Through learning, we aim to empower youth all over the world to build their own future.

This is the beginning of our journey. A small group with a vision. But it can be the beginning of something much better, a world where people enjoy learning, where it's not a duty but an experience.

Follow us on the way to realizing that!
